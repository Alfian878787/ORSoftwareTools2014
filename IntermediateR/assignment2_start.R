# Output: proportion of durations >= 30
# Hint: recall that the mean of a TRUE/FALSE vector is the
#       proportion that are TRUE. For instance,
#       mean(trips$Gender == "Male") is the proportion of
#       trips taken by males.

# After this, you would run in the console (with appropriate
# values filled in):

# tapply([data], [category], [function])
